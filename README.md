Sure! Here's a sample `README.md` file for the `go-check` project:

# go-check

`go-check` is a command-line tool that helps you to check, format, and parse Go code. It is similar to the `cargo check` tool for Rust.

## Installation

To install `go-check`, you will need to have Go installed on your system. You can download and install Go from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/

Once you have Go installed, you can install `go-check` by following these steps:

1. Clone the `go-check` GitHub repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/theghostmac/go-check.git
   ```

2. Change to the `go-check` directory:

   ```
   cd go-check
   ```

3. Build the tool:

   ```
   go build -o go-check
   ```

4. Install the tool:

   ```
   sudo cp go-check /usr/local/bin/
   ```

   This will copy the `go-check` executable to the `/usr/local/bin` directory, which is typically included in the system's `PATH`.

## Usage

To use `go-check`, simply navigate to the directory containing your Go code and run the `go-check` command:

```
cd /path/to/your/go/code
go-check
```

This will run `go vet`, `go fmt`, and `go list` on your code and print a summary of the number of files checked, the number of errors, and the number of warnings to the console.
